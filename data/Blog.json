    "description": "We don’t need to tell you why Atari is the most famous name in video games. But here’s a reminder. Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney started one of the most iconic companies in American history in 1972. With $700 in investment capital, they launched Syzygy to develop a Spacewar computer game clone called Computer Space. They changed the name to Atari later that year, after the Japanese word atari 当たり, used in the notoriously complex game, Go. You know the rest. Pac-Man, Asteroids, Missile Command, Frogger. All on the Atari 2600. Atari and Quidd are collaborating to bring you historic collectibles from the archives. To learn more about Quidd and our Atari collections, go to myquidd.com",

The illness is in my family and in that of close friends of mine, and this work is more of a raw expression of emotion than anything else. Holding hands with a person who is fading away is a strong experience, one that allows oneself to recalibrate and to, in a way, regenerate one\u0027s vision of what life is, what a person is, what relationships are.

The future vision of this project is to integrate it as an ERC-6551 and establish the attachment in the blockchain of every PFP that purchases a house, thus creating a direct link between the respective PFP and the purchased house.",

PO{A}W uses bespoke software to explore these on-demand, inspired by the logic underpinning Google Maps. PO{A}W is an early example of an on-chain NFT collection, with token IDs representing unique z_0 values for the equation above. As aesthetically pleasing IDs are rare and must be found at random, their discovery can be considered akin to blockchain mining—with a reward of an artistic proof.

Hence the subject of this NFT collection: Munger (who is more photogenic) and occasionally Warren, constantly trying to exterminate the ubiquitous Bitcoin Rats. These rats are proud Bitcoin hodlers and survivors! This collection will showcase 2400 failed attempts to poison and kill Bitcoin Rats! SBF managed to do more harm to cryptocurrencies in 1 day than these legendary investors have done in a decade!

Laughter echoed, triumph reverberated in The City of Hearts. The characters embraced their whimsical essence, defying the White Witch\u0027s attempts.

My creative process is a fusion of experimentation and spontaneity. I initiate each artwork with a conceptual or emotional text, which I then transform into an absurd visual narrative. I repeat this process until the narrative unveils an unexpected facet of the human psyche. Both classical and modern art have lost their ability to reflect the psychology of newer generations. The anxieties, insecurities, alienation, and mental fatigue experienced behind the scenes necessitate a new artistic grammar. My aim is to discover a fresh visual strategy and vocabulary that can effectively convey these tensions and accurately reflect the psyche of the new generation.",

It diverges from the typical, grim, metallic clones by adopting a pastel pop aesthetic and offering a new visual language. This collection redefines perceptions of cloning in popular culture and science, distinguishing it from traditional representations. Both unsettling and absurd at the same time, the collection symbolizes the banality and redundancy of advanced technology. The pieces represent clones as mere products of consumer society rather than scientific marvels, seamlessly integrating into the mundane. It critiques consumer society and the trivialization of individuality through mass production, reflecting on a world where everything, even humanity, is commodified and disposable. The use of soft pastels contrasts against the eerie sterility of cloning technology, revealing an absurdity in existence. The color palette",

Like all the animals of the old planet, even those of the clods have evolved to adapt to various situations. Often their mutations occur due to pollution. What they eat, drink or breathe changes their habits and consequently their body. These pets, despite being nice and having descriptions that often tear a smile, deal with issues that represent us from my point of view. They deal with pollution, social relationships etc. What I recommend is, when looking at a pet, to go beyond the simple representation, and imagine what is behind each of them.

Although it’s not clear exactly what transpired, scenes of abandoned factories hint at an industrially triggered climate disaster.

Evidence of the rabbit\u0027s role throughout history emerges in ancient documents, from Eastern block printing to Mughal Empire paintings to Medieval parchments, and mythic dot paintings. The rabbit has always been with us. RABBIT TAKEOVER is based on my irascible, aggressive, much-loved pet rabbit Pickles, who sadly passed away as this was being developed.

After these dark days, legends began to emerge among the surviving collections, from which the cries were still heard and the lost souls wandered the blockchain. From these dark days were born THE GHOSTS WHO WERE ON THE LOOSE. These ghosts came to plague the collections and communities that were still standing, thus becoming the worst nightmares in the world of NFT’s.",

The journey began with Voyage and DOM, exploring the code of boats, seas, and cities before venturing into the ancient hinterlands with their stone walls and towers. In the realm of art, as music and design, aesthetics alone are not enough; it must also communicate. With this in mind, I introduced a special character that not only weaves the narrative but also harmonizes with the landscapes of my hearth, evoking a profound sense of tranquility. Let Soothe speak as my personal journey through times and spaces of creating generative art. And hopefully, you will find your own stories it can tell. Hope you will enjoy your mint.

As both an amateur enthusiast of instant film eroticism photography for years and an on-chain art curator, I view Timeless Diffusions and digital dithering as a sensual tribute to the past’s chemical diffusion, an emblematic process that marked a captivating era and resonated with eroticism and authenticity. With this ethos, this collection will always emphasize the immediacy of intimate moments. Every future piece will be shot and minted with pure spontaneity—one diffusion dithering at a time.",

The title, translated as Alan’s Eyes, alludes to Alan Turing’s machine intelligence test - a thought experiment foreshadowing a moment in which we can no longer differentiate between the real and the artificial. Though first proposed in 1950, the topic feels especially relevant today, as even our creative practices are being carried by shifting technological tides. The algorithms and decision-making encoded into this generative art project intentionally imitate Fahad’s approach on traditional mediums - composition rules, textures, and overall themes. The visual elements are inspired by Fahad’s memories from his nomadic life.

Although his works embody the dangerous and dark reality of the streets, beneath their gritty charm, there also exists a deep layer of pensive composition. Now fully digitized and animated for the first time ever, we are proud to announce that Rick Prol’s “Surveillance Cat-O-Puss” and \" Empty City III\"has been made exclusive for OrangeHare. From Shakespeare to Goya, these piece is consistent with his style, which draws inspiration from a variety of interests that seem to take root in that era’s fertile punk soil, ultimately growing into something that is both simultaneously unsettling, humorous, and truly one of a kind. As one of Jean-Michel Basquiat’s oldest friends and…",

    "description": "…that exist between the past and present, striking a balance between tradition and innovation. Flourish’s logic uses a linguistic structure that treats simple shapes like an alphabet and arranges geometry into phrases, establishing and dissolving symmetries. This logic is similar to a formal grammar system with rules that describe how words can be combined to form sentences. As a very simple example, a rule for the English language might be that a noun phrase can be followed by a verb phrase. So, a person dances, a cat sleeps, a bird sings. In the context of Flourish, pentagons can be subdivided into triangles, which can be enclosed by circles to create complex patterns. As geometry is combined and rearranged, the linguistic-like structure of the image changes, which also changes the next possible sets of geometric operations. The palettes reflect various eras and mediums, invoking the feeling of aged archival…",

The exhibited piece, “Paying Debts” is from a time where the strictly-collage style was expanding with a layer of illustrations. The main classical art piece that “Paying Debts” is based on is “The Last Statement” by Arthur Kampf. This piece is important to me because it shows how far my art has come. My work gained traction in 2021, but not many people have looked back at my older work and how it has consistently evolved into where it is today.

She walks alone, her heart in fear, With every step, the end seems near. Monsters lurk, shadows surround, She tries to scream, but makes no sound. The woman longs to break free, From this dark and twisted reality. But with each passing moment, it seems, She\u0027s trapped in this land of bad dreams. Yet deep within her heart still glows, A hope that someday, she\u0027ll outgrow This nightmare land and its evil throng, And wake up to a brighter dawn.\" | Other Collections |",

Hidden on the screen, an arrangement of shapes populate the space. When a photon collides with the edge of a shape, it either reflects off or refracts through its surface, changing the photon\u0027s direction and color. These photons leave small circles along their path...the only drawn element in the artwork. This painting of light both reveals the hidden forms below and ties their chaotic arrangement together.

I have attempted to make each output feel nostalgic and fresh at the same time. The blocks, which have lost their original meaning, are contrasted with the data, which exists in isolation from them, in stillness and movement. Occasional red clouds or blocks mean that they are corrected as red, the first color, due to missing information. Through these integrations, I have attempted to create a work that can be stored on a blockchain, and that is both visually and sonically interactive.

Working off her own works with acrylic painting, Dounia, who has originally caught the attention of the crypto art world as an illustrator, makes a bold move into generative art. Spannungsbogen is a series of AI generated animations which are outputs of a GAN trained with 2,000 abstract acrylic vignettes hand painted by the artist. These outputs are then arranged following an indexing system that considers form, colour, and texture. The work is inspired by the Fremen of Frank Herbert’s Dune, and the relationship of this group of people with the mighty sandworms.

My cat Slippy that passed away a few years ago, gave me so much love and happiness. The least I could do is to find a way to help other animals and give them more care. Once we reach our collection goals, photos and information of where the money went for a local animal shelter will be provided on my twitter account. Thank you for being a part of Animals of Change and help contribute to an amazing and worthy cause All Love",

Background information for your enjoyment: In 2010, Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato posted several photos of her rescue-adopted Shiba Inu, Kabosu, to her blog. Among the photos was a peculiar shot of Kabosu gazing sideways at the camera, which quickly became an iconic meme. A decade later, Ms. Sato minted the original image as an NFT on Ethereum, which was purchased in auction by PleasrDAO. Following the auction, Pleasr launched and auctioned a derivative token, $DOG, representing a piece of the NFT. Every pixel in this collection was minted on the Doge Pixel Portal by locking up 55,240 $DOG (per pixel). Hold, trade, or burn to redeem $DOG - the choice is yours. We hope you enjoy!",

On a time locked schedule, a blockchain transaction can be triggered to metaphorically \"capture\" an observation of a Noumenon, minting a new ERC721 token in this companion series.
