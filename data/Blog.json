As a very simple example, a rule for the English language might be that a noun phrase can be followed by a verb phrase. So, a person dances, a cat sleeps, a bird sings. In the context of Flourish, pentagons can be subdivided into triangles, which can be enclosed by circles to create complex patterns.

    "description": "Reflecting on issues of discrimination in face recognition technology and the lack of representation of non western artworks in GAN generated art, Linda Dounia brings the first large scale AI drop by an African woman. Working off her own works with acrylic painting, Dounia, who has originally caught the attention of the crypto art world as an illustrator, makes a bold move into generative art. Spannungsbogen is a series of AI generated animations which are outputs of a GAN trained with 2,000 abstract acrylic vignettes hand painted by the artist. These outputs are then arranged following an indexing system that considers form, colour, and texture. The work is inspired by the Fremen of Frank Herbert‚Äôs Dune, and the relationship of this group of people with the mighty sandworms. In Herbert‚Äôs words, spannungsbogen is ‚Äòthe self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out‚Ä¶",

    "description": "Vincent van Gogh, recovering from a mental breakdown, expressed a fierce determination for work in a letter to his brother. This resolve fueled an extraordinary burst of creativity in autumn 1889 during his stay in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence. Amidst the Proven√ßal landscape, he painted ‚ÄúCabanes de bois parmi les oliviers et cypr√®s‚Äù in October 1889, capturing the sun-drenched scenery with olive trees and cypresses. Van Gogh, residing in Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, an asylum on the outskirts of Saint-R√©my, found solace and inspiration in the surroundings. His fascination with olive trees, depicted in a series of works, symbolized his struggle and served as a tonic for his mental well-being. The painting, acquired by his brother Theo and later passing through notable collections, reflects Van Gogh‚Äôs mature style and his profound connection to the vibrant landscape of Provence.",

As both an amateur enthusiast of instant film eroticism photography for years and an on-chain art curator, I view Timeless Diffusions and digital dithering as a sensual tribute to the past‚Äôs chemical diffusion, an emblematic process that marked a captivating era and resonated with eroticism and authenticity.

Hence the subject of this NFT collection: Munger (who is more photogenic) and occasionally Warren, constantly trying to exterminate the ubiquitous Bitcoin Rats. These rats are proud Bitcoin hodlers and survivors! This collection will showcase 2400 failed attempts to poison and kill Bitcoin Rats! SBF managed to do more harm to cryptocurrencies in 1 day than these legendary investors have done in a decade! I propose that secretly Buffet and Munger are in fact reluctant members of an elite Bitcoin Appreciation Society because of the FEDs humungous quantitative easing and the cost of living‚Ä¶",

Bella then played the role of Art Director ‚Äì collaborating with her father while the collection was expanded and refined. What are CUBS? Cubs are the young of a bear, lion, wolf or other carnivorous mammal. All Cubs look somewhat similar, but they are different at the core ‚Äì just like siblings in a family. Certain Cubs are expressionless, while others are a bit nerdy, suspicious, or even bored. Some Cubs are also cleaner than others!

N√§ra allows the viewer to explore and experience these graphs as a metaphor for the organic, organised chaos that is life. Shapes connect from one node in a graph to the next, sometimes spilling over, doubling down and creating layers of intricacy.

The exclusive Perimeter Town set is his gift to collectors, born from these uncharted territories. SIGHTSEERS, Harman\u0027s pioneering collection, crafts a narrative that intertwines humanity\u0027s present predicaments with the nascent stages of the cryptoart revolution. His tableau, echoing the oblivious onlookers of the 1950s nuclear bomb tests, houses figures suspended in blithe oblivion. Against this stark canvas, Harman paints a foreboding picture of the potential for catastrophe in AI\u0027s unchartered frontier. A luminary in the cryptoart realm, Harman breathes new depth into AI art. He masterfully blends traditional painting and digital disruptions, crafting an unflinching critique of societal decadence, distraction, and conformity through his art.

    "description": "A community of unknowns who are just trying to keep the local pet at ease. Conceptualized by some kids who have all grown up. Morvixity was created in 2016 by my kids. The original idea and the endgame is to build a gaming experience using the 7 characters. In January of 2022, I was doing some cleaning and found the original drawings. I thought Morvixity would be a great way to get started in the NFT world. My goal is to build this NFT collection and use the money from the NFT sales to develop a game and establish the Morvixity brand. The original drop of 25 1/1 NFT\u0027s was minted in February 2022. This collection will be back new and improved. Thank you for your support.",

    "description": "A lone rabbit is seen cavorting about in a post-armageddon world. Although it‚Äôs not clear exactly what transpired, scenes of abandoned factories hint at an industrially triggered climate disaster. Traveling through swirling trans-dimensional portals, the rabbit presides over scenes of mayhem and destruction. Evidence of the rabbit\u0027s role throughout history emerges in ancient documents, from Eastern block printing to Mughal Empire paintings to Medieval parchments, and mythic dot paintings. The rabbit has always been with us. RABBIT TAKEOVER is based on my irascible, aggressive, much-loved pet rabbit Pickles, who sadly passed away as this was being developed. NOTE: Opensea compresses images: original files are 2048x2048. You can download from IPFS.",

The Mad Hatter, with a patchwork hat and mischievous twinkle, presided. Alice and the Queen of Rats joined, as did the cryptic Raven and sly Fox. As tea brewed, secrets whispered and giggles filled the air. New characters emerged, infusing Wonderland with vibrant life. They defied the icy grip of the White Witch, taunting her. The Mad Hatter declared their defiance, the Queen of Rats added their laughter burned bright, and Alice affirmed their reclaiming of Wonderland\u0027s spirit. Laughter echoed, triumph reverberated in The City of Hearts. The characters embraced their whimsical essence, defying the White Witch\u0027s attempts. In Wonderland, dreams thrived, and the spirit remained unyielding. Even the coldest hearts couldn\u0027t quell the fire of wonder.",

What they eat, drink or breathe changes their habits and consequently their body. These pets, despite being nice and having descriptions that often tear a smile, deal with issues that represent us from my point of view. They deal with pollution, social relationships etc. What I recommend is, when looking at a pet, to go beyond the simple representation, and imagine what is behind each of them. Clods\u0027 Pet have several rarities: Super rare, rare, uncommon and common.",

Hidden on the screen, an arrangement of shapes populate the space. When a photon collides with the edge of a shape, it either reflects off or refracts through its surface, changing the photon\u0027s direction and color. These photons leave small circles along their path...the only drawn element in the artwork. This painting of light both reveals the hidden forms below and ties their chaotic arrangement together.

Background information for your enjoyment: In 2010, Japanese kindergarten teacher Atsuko Sato posted several photos of her rescue-adopted Shiba Inu, Kabosu, to her blog. Among the photos was a peculiar shot of Kabosu gazing sideways at the camera, which quickly became an iconic meme. A decade later, Ms. Sato minted the original image as an NFT on Ethereum, which was purchased in auction by PleasrDAO. Following the auction, Pleasr launched and auctioned a derivative token, $DOG, representing a piece of the NFT. Every pixel in this collection was minted on the Doge Pixel Portal by locking up 55,240 $DOG (per pixel). Hold, trade, or burn to redeem $DOG - the choice is yours. We hope you enjoy!",

Rare and extraordinary can only be achieved if a previously made Chubby Cat gets colored in or gets a background drawn. Every cat that gets colored in or has a background is bumped up a rarity. So a limited cat that gets colored in and has a background drawn will be extraordinary. You\u0027ll never see a rare or extraordinary cat that is black and white with no background, Chubby Cats by themselves can only reach limited.",

None are AI generated, and none do the thing that certain monkey NFT collection does where different parts are randomly applied to a monkey. Because of this, each Chubby Cat is completely unique. The Chubby Cats have a rarity system, it goes common, uncommon, limited, rare, and extraordinary. Rare and extraordinary can only be achieved if a previously made Chubby Cat gets colored in or gets a background drawn. Every cat that gets colored in or has a background is bumped up a rarity. So a limited cat that gets colored in and has a background drawn will be extraordinary. You\u0027ll never‚Ä¶",

Exponentially more rare is the planetary transit. When Venus hangs on the horizon, glowing against the night sky, it is all too easy to think it another star.

This work is made in support of The Los Angeles County Museum of Art\u0027s Art and Technology Lab, in collaboration with Cactoid Labs, presented in dialogue with the chronophotopgraphic work of Eadweard Muybridge in the LACMA archives. On a time locked schedule, a blockchain transaction can be triggered to metaphorically \"capture\" an observation of a Noumenon, minting a new ERC721 token in this companion series. The blocknumber serves as the seed for a deterministic program to generate an image in the style of Muybridge\u0027s chronophotographs, representing the attempt to transcend sensory limitations through the use of technology. Viewers are encouraged to reflect on the perception of time, consensus reality, photography and blockchain as sources of objective truth, limitations thereof.",
